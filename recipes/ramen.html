                <li>Homemade Chashu (Japanese Braised Pork Belly) </li>
                <li>Spicy Bean Sprout Salad</li>
                <li>Ramen Egg (Ajitsuke Tamago)</li>
                <li>frozen or canned corn (drained)</li>
                <li>nori (dried laver seaweed)</li>
                <li>green onion/scallion</li>

            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mince or press 2 cloves garlic (I use a garlic press) and add to a small plate. Then, grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater) and add 1/2 tsp ginger (grated) to the plate.</li>
                <li>Mince 1 shallot and add to the plate and set these three prepared ingredients aside.</li>
                <li>Grind 1 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds, leaving some seeds unground for texture. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of unsalted water to a boil (ramen noodles already include salt in the dough). When the water is boiling, ladle some of the hot water into the individual ramen bowls to warm them up. Meanwhile, gently shake 2 servings fresh ramen noodles with your hand to separate and loosen them up.</li>
                <li>Cook the noodles according to the package instructions. I usually cook the noodles al dente (about 15 seconds less than the suggested cooking time). Before your noodles are done cooking, empty the hot water from the warmed ramen bowls.</li>
                <li>When the noodles are done, quickly pick them up with a mesh sieve and shake out the excess water. Make sure to drain the water well, as you don't want it to dilute your soup. Serve the noodles into the warmed bowls.</li>
                <li>Add the piping-hot ramen soup broth to each bowl</li>
                <li>Place the toppings of your choice on the ramen noodles and serve immediately. Add the optional condiments to your Miso Ramen and enjoy</li>
            </ol>
